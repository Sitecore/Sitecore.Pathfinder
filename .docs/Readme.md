# Sitecore Pathfinder

## Notes
* Project contains full truth
* Project is files only
* Editor agnostic
* Build agnostic
* No IDs
* No references outside project - project is self-contained
* Sitecore Server does not heavy lifting - scc.exe just build the package - Sitecore Server is where the developer is
* scc.exe creates folder structure and packages it; server unpacks packages and installs folder structure
* Building rebuild entire project - to build partial use different build files
