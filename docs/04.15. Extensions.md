# Extensions
Pathfinder includes the Roslyn compiler to compile extensions on the fly. Extensions are C# files that are compiled and loaded dynamically through 
[MEF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460648(v=vs.110).aspx). This allows you to extend Pathfinder with new tasks, checkers, code 
generation handler and much more. 

When Pathfinder starts it looks through the [Tools]/files/extensions and [Project]/sitecore.project/extensions directories to find any 
extension files, and if any file is newer than the Sitecore.Pathfinder.Extensions.dll assembly, it recompiles the files and saves the 
output as Sitecore.Pathfinder.Extensions.dll.

For instance to make a new checker, duplicate a file in [Tools]/files/extensions/checkers and start Pathfinder. Pathfinder will detect the
new file and recompile the assembly.
