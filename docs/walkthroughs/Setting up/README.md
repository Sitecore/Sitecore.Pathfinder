# Setting up

This walkthrough shows how to setup Pathfinder initially.

## Download Pathfinder

You can download Pathfinder from [here](https://github.com/JakobChristensen/Sitecore.Pathfinder/releases). Unzip
the file to the Program Files folder, e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\SitecorePathfinder`.

The path of the scc.cmd file should be something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\SitecorePathfinder\scc.cmd`.

Make sure that .NET Core 1.1 is installed.

## Add the directory to the Path environment variable
By adding the directory, you just created, to the path, you can execute scc.cmd from any location.

Open the Windows Advanced System Properties and add the directory to the Path variable.
