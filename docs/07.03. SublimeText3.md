# Atom 
[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a good code editor with lots of plugins. You need to install a build package to be
able to run the Pathfinder build pipeline, e.g. [Build](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) by nosegild.

After creating an Atom project, the default build task has been configured to execute the build pipeline in Pathfinder. 
In Atom the build task can be executed by pressing Ctrl+Alt+B.

To create a Atom project, run this command ``scc init-atom``. This will create a .atom-build.json file
that contains default configuration for Pathfinder.
