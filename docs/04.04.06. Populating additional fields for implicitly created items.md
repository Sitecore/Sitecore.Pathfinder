# Populating additional fields for implicitly created items

Supposed you have an MVC View rendering HelloWorld.cshtml and want to set the Parameters field, simply create a HelloWorld.item.json (or 
HelloWorld.item.xml or HelloWorld.item.yaml) next to the HelloWorld.cshtml file.

* HelloWorld.cshtml
* HelloWorld.item.json

When determining the item name, Pathfinder uses the field up until the first dot - in this case "HelloWorld". When two or more files have the
same item name (and item path), they are merged into a single item. Pathfinder will report an error if a field is set more than once with different
values.
