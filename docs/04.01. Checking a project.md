# Checking a project
As a compiler, one of the primary goals for Pathfinder is to ensure that the project does not contain errors and provide warnings for 
potential problems. The is one of the main reasons, a Pathfinder project must contain the whole truth about the project.

After the project is loaded and parsed, Pathfinder will invoke a number of checkers, e.g. the Reference checker, that ensures that all
references between items and between items and files are valid.

A checker can be disabled, if it is not appropriate for a particular project.

New checkers can be implemented by adding extensions (see Extensions) or by using the rules in the Convention checker.
