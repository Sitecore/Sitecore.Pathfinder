# TodoMVC
The TodoMvc starter kit is a SPEAK based application that implements a Todo application similar to [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).
It uses Sitecore renderings and shows how to implement a new SPEAK rendering (TodoMvcList). It also uses an ASP.NET handler to
create, update and delete todo items.
