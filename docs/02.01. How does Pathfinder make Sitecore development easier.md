# How does Pathfinder make Sitecore development easier
* Familiar developer experience: Edit source files, build project, test, repeat...
* Text editor agnostic (Visual Studio not required - use Notepad, Notepad++, SublimeText, Atom, VS Code etc.)
* Build process agnostic (command-line tool, so it integrates easily with Grunt, Gulp, MSBuild etc.)
* Everything is a file (easy to edit, search and replace across multiple files, source control friendly)
* Project directory has whole and single truth (source is not spead across development projects, databases and websites) (contineous integration friendly) 
* Project is packaged into a NuGet package and deployed to the website
  * Dependency tracking through NuGet dependencies
  * NuGet package installer on Sitecore website
  * SitecorePathfinderCore NuGet package tweaks Sitecore defaults to be easier to work with (e.g. removes initial workflow)
* Support for Html Templates (with [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) tags) makes getting started with the Sitecore Rendering Engine easier
* Code Generation for generating strongly typed item model, factories and unit tests
* Validate a Sitecore website against 70 rules using Sitecore Rocks SitecoreCop
