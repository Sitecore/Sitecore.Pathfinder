# React
Pathfinder support React renderings (.jsx).

This means that you can copy a .jsx to your project and Pathfinder will create a view rendering item for it.
Pathfinder also provides an Sitecore.MVC renderer for .jsx files, so the .jsx are actually rendered.

Pathfinder requires [ReactJS.NET](http://reactjs.net/) to be installed on the website, and you must do this
yourself, since the process is complicated.

In a .jsx you have access to all non-system fields on the data source and placeholders through the `props` variable.
Experience Editor is supported.

To render the field Text field use:
```js
{ this.props.Text}
```
 
Please notice that all placeholder names must be specified in the "Place Holders" field in the View Rendering item -
otherwise the React renderer will not know about the placeholders. While building Pathfinders uses a regular expression 
by default to extract all placeholders from the .jsx file.

To render the "Content" placeholder use:
```js
{ this.props.placeholders.Content }
```

In SPEAK, you can use "$Id" to refer to the Control ID of the rendering. This works in .jsx renderings as well.
To render the "MyControl.Content" placeholder use:
```js
{ this.props.placeholders.$Id.Content }
```

Notice the case of the "$Id".
