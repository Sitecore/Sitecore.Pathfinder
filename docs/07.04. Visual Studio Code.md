# Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a nice code editor. After creating a VS Code project,
the default build task has been configured to execute the build pipeline in Pathfinder. In Code the build task 
can be executed by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B.

To create a VS Code project, run this command ``scc init-vscode``. This will create a .vscode directory
that contains default configuration for Pathfinder.
