Starter Kit | Description
------------|------------
Clean Blog  | A simple blogging website.
HelloWorld  | Well, guess what this is...
TodoMVC     | A SPEAK based Todo list.

## CleanBlog
Clean Blog is a read-only blog website based on the [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - 
[Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) template. It is very basic and uses Html Template files
instead of Sitecore Renderings.

## HelloWorld
No further introduction needed.

## TodoMVC
The TodoMvc starter kit is a SPEAK based application that implements a Todo application similar to [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).
It uses Sitecore renderings and shows how to implement a new SPEAK rendering (TodoMvcList). It also uses an ASP.NET handler to
create, update and delete todo items.
