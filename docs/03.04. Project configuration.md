# Configuration
Pathfinder is configured using a global configuration file, a project configuration file, and optionally a machine/project configuration file 
and a user configuration file. The user, machine/project and project configuration files can overwrite any settings in the 
global configuration file.

The global configuration is located in the [Tools] directory. You should never change this file. Instead overwrite settings in 
the project or user configuration files.

[Global configuration: /sitecore.tools/scconfig.json](https://github.com/JakobChristensen/Sitecore.Pathfinder/blob/master/src/Sitecore.Pathfinder.Console/scconfig.json)

The project configuration file is located in the root of the project: [Project]/scconfig.json.

[Project configuration: /scconfig.json](https://github.com/JakobChristensen/Sitecore.Pathfinder/blob/master/src/Sitecore.Pathfinder.Console/files/project/scconfig.json)

The user configuration file is optional and is located next to the project configuration file. It has the extension .user.

[Tools]/scconfig.json (global configuration)

[Project]/scconfig.json (project configuration)

[Tools]/files/project.roles/scconfig.role.[Project role].json (project role configuration)
