# Synchronizing project and website
In Pathfinder the project contains the whole truth. However a project may need to use items, template, renderings from a standard 
Sitecore website. If these resources are not available as packages, you can generate the using Pathfinder.

These external resources can be imported into the project by using the ``sync-website`` task. This task makes a request to the website
to collect the needed information. The information is downloaded as a zip file and unpacked in the [Project] directory.

The sync-website task is configured on the 'sync-website' section in the scconfig.json configuration file.

```js
"sync-website": {
    "Json schema for layouts in Master database": {
        "file": "sitecore.project/schemas/master.layout.schema.json",
        "database": "master"
    },
    "Json schema for layouts in Core database": {
        "file": "sitecore.project/schemas/core.layout.schema.json",
        "database": "core"
    },
    "Xml schema for layouts in Master database": {
        "file": "sitecore.project/schemas/master.layout.xsd",
        "database": "master",
        "namespace": "http://www.sitecore.net/pathfinder/layouts/master"
    },
    "Xml schema for layouts in Core database": {
        "file": "sitecore.project/schemas/core.layout.xsd",
        "database": "core",
        "namespace": "http://www.sitecore.net/pathfinder/layouts/core"
    },
    "Xml schema for content in Master database": {
        "file": "sitecore.project/schemas/master.content.xsd",
        "database": "master",
        "namespace": "http://www.sitecore.net/pathfinder/content/master"
    },
    "Xml schema for content in Core database": {
        "file": "sitecore.project/schemas/core.content.xsd",
        "database": "core",
        "namespace": "http://www.sitecore.net/pathfinder/content/core"
    }
}
```

By default various schema files for Json and Xml are generated and downloaded. The ``file`` property determines where the generated
is unpack in the [Project] directory.
