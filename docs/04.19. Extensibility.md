# Extensibility
Pathfinder uses [MEF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460648(v=vs.110).aspx) internally and is fully pluggable. See section on 
extensions.

## Add-ins and Repository
The repository (located in [Tools]/files/repository) contains a number of packages and files that can be added to the project.
Specifically there are NuGet packages with external references to the master and core databases and various SPEAK packages.

To list the add-ins in the repository, use the `scc list-addin` task.

To install an add-in from the repository, use the `scc install-addin [file name]` task. This will create the file 
[Project]\sitecore.project\addins.xml which contains a list of all installed add-ins.

To update all installed add-ins in a project, use `scc update-addins` task. This will reinstall all add-ins that are listed in the
[Project]\sitecore.project\addins.xml file.

## Extensions
Pathfinder includes the Roslyn compiler to compile extensions on the fly. Extensions are C# files that are compiled and loaded dynamically through 
[MEF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460648(v=vs.110).aspx). This allows you to extend Pathfinder with new tasks, checkers, code 
generation handler and much more. 

When Pathfinder starts it looks through the [Tools]/files/extensions and [Project]/sitecore.project/extensions directories to find any 
extension files, and if any file is newer than the Sitecore.Pathfinder.Extensions.dll assembly, it recompiles the files and saves the 
output as Sitecore.Pathfinder.Extensions.dll.

For instance to make a new checker, duplicate a file in [Tools]/files/extensions/checkers and start Pathfinder. Pathfinder will detect the
new file and recompile the assembly.
