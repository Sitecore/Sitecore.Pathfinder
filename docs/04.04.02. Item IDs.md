# Item IDs
Normally you do not need to specify the ID of an item, but in some cases, it may be necessary. Pathfinder supports soft IDs meaning that the
item ID does not have to be a Guid (but it can be).

By default Pathfinder calculates the ID of an item hashing the project unique ID and the file path (without file extensions) like this 
`item.Guid = MD5((Project_Unique_ID + item.FilePath).ToUpperInvariant())`. This means that the item ID is always the same, as long as the 
file path remains the same.

You can explicitly set the ID by specifying the ID in item file as either a Guid or as a soft ID.

* If no ID is specified, the item ID is calculated as `item.Guid = MD5((Project_Unique_ID + item.FilePath).ToUpperInvariant())`.
* If the ID is specified as a Guid, the item ID uses Guid as is.
* If the ID is specified and starts with '{' and ends with '}' (a soft ID), the item ID is calculated as `item.Guid = MD5(item.ID)`.
* If the ID is specified (but not a Guid), the item ID is calculated as `item.Guid = MD5((Project_Unique_ID + item.ID).ToUpperInvariant())`.

If you rename an item, but want to keep the original item ID, specify the ID as the original file path (without extensions), e.g.:
```xml
<Item xmlns="http://www.sitecore.net/pathfinder/item" 
    Id="/sitecore/content/Home/HelloWorld" 
    Template="/sitecore/templates/Sample/Sample Item">
    <Fields>
        <Field Name="Title">Pathfinder</Field>
        <Field Name="Text">Welcome to Pathfinder</Field>
    </Fields>
</Item>
```
