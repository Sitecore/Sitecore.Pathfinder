# Sitecore rendering engine
Pathfinder supports the Sitecore Rendering Engine by supporting a special format for the __Rendering field. 
The format is similar to Html and Xaml, and is parsed when the package is installed into Xml format, that 
Sitecore expects. 

Here is an example of the format in Json.
```js
{
    "Layout": {
        "Devices": [
            {
                "Name": "Default",
                "Layout": "/sitecore/layout/layouts/MvcLayout",
                "Renderings": [
                    {
                      "HelloWorld": {
                      } 
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
