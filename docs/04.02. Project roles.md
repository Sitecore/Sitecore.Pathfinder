# Project roles
A classic website project is very different from a SPEAK project, e.g. a classic website lives in the Master database, while SPEAK lives
in the Core database under /sitecore/client.

You can configure a project to have a certain role in the scconfig.json by setting the "project-role" option.

The project role may be used in various tasks; it may enable or disable certain checkers, affect how code is generated
in the `generate-code` task, change the deployments targets etc.

The Convention checker is deeply affected by the project role, since conventions are depending on the project role, e.g. by convention SPEAK 
items must be located in the Core database under /sitecore/client.

The project role also causes a configuration file to be loaded from the [Tools] directory. This config file contains special configuration for that
particular role. Conventions are typically specified in this file. Suppose a project has the role "speak", this will load the configuration
file [Tools]/files/project.roles/sitecore.role.speak.json - the "habitat.framework" role will load the 
[Tools]/files/project.roles/sitecore.role.habitat.framework.json file.
