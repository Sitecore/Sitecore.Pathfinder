### Content item format
Content item files also contain items, but the schema is different. When you synchronize the website, Pathfinder generates and downloads a
schema, that contains all templates in the database (master and core database). If you change a template, you will have to synchronize the
website again.

The schema of content files ensures, that you can only specify fields that appear in the template, and provide some nice Intellisense in many
code editors. The format of content item files is also more compact than other types of item files.

So the advantages of content item files are validation against the template and a more compact format, but you have to synchronize the 
website, if you change a template.

```xml
<Root Database="master" Name="sitecore" ParentItemPath="/">
    <Main.Section Name="layout">
        <Node Name="Layouts">
            <View.Rendering Name="MvcLayout" Path="/layout/layouts/MvcLayout.cshtml" Place.Holders="Page.Body"/>
        </Node>
    </Main.Section>
</Root>
```

If the item contains characters, that are not allowed in Xml item names (including spaces), the characters are replaced by a dot (.).
