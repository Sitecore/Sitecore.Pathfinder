# Building a project
The build tool chain is specified in the build-project/tasks configuration setting. The default value is 
``"check-project write-exports pack-NuGet copy-dependencies copy-package install-package publish-database show-metrics"``.

1. Check the project for warnings and errors. Any errors will stop the build.
2. Writes export declarations to the [Project]/sitecore.project/exports.xml file.
3. Create a NuGet package from the project.
4. Copy dependency files from the [Project]/sitecore.project/packages directory to the website ([DataFolder]/Pathfinder/Available).
5. Copy package [Project]/sitecore.project/Sitecore.nupkg to the website ([Data]/Pathfinder/Available).
6. Install the package by making a request to the website: [Website]/sitecore/shell/client/Applications/Pathfinder/InstallPackage
7. Publish the Master database by making a request to the website: [Website]/sitecore/shell/client/Applications/Pathfinder/Publish
8. Show project metrics.

## Dependencies and exports
A project can declare items and resources that are used by other projects. The `write-exports` task writes export declarations of all
items and templates in the project to the [Project]/sitecore.project/exports.xml file.

When a project is being compiled, Pathfinder will look for NuGet packages in the [Project]/sitecore.project/packages directory and 
extract any exports.xml files. All declared items and templates are added to the project as external references.

### Dependency packages
A project can depend on other NuGet packages using the standard NuGet dependency mechanism. Dependency packages are located in the
[Project]/sitecore.project/packages directory. As part of deploying these packages are copied to the website and installed.

To add a new dependency package, copy the file (.nupkg) to the [Project]/sitecore.project/packages directory. In the Nuspec file [Project]/sitecore.project/sitecore.nuspec
add the filename to the ``dependencies`` tag like this (see [Nuspec Reference](https://docs.NuGet.org/create/nuspec-reference)):

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency id="SitecorePathfinderCore" version="1.0.0" />
    <dependency id="SitecorePowerShellExtensions32ForSitecore8" version="1.0.0" />
</dependencies>
```

The SitecorePowerShellExtensions32ForSitecore8.nupkg will be copied to the [DataFolder]/Pathfinder/Available directory.

Standard Sitecore Packages cannot be used directly as dependencies since NuGet does not understand Sitecore packages. Instead you have to wrap
a Sitecore Package in a NuGet package. There are different way to do this. 

First of all you can convert the Sitecore Package to a NuGet package using a community tool like this

* [CreateSitecoreNuGetPackage](http://hermanussen.eu/sitecore/wordpress/2013/05/turn----any----sitecore----package----into----a----NuGet----package/) by Robin Hermanussen

Alternatively Pathfinder contains the 'pack-dependencies' task that simply converts all *.zip files in the [Project]/sitecore.project/packages directory 
to NuGet packages. For each zip file it creates a NuGet package where the zip files is located in the content/packages directory in the .nupkg file. 
Pathfinder understands, that any zip files in the content/packages directory is a Sitecore Package and installs it.

Finally you can create the NuGet package manually by creating a Nuspec file like this:

```xml
<package xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd\">
    <metadata>
        <id>MyPackage</id>
        <title>My Package</title>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <authors>Me</authors>
        <requireLicenseAcceptance>false</requireLicenseAcceptance>
        <description>My package</description>
    </metadata>
    <files>
        <file src="mypackage.zip" target="content\packages\mypackage.zip"/>
    </files>
</package>
```
