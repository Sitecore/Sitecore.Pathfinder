# Getting started
The goal of Pathfinder is to make it easy to start working with Sitecore.

## Installing Pathfinder
1. Download [Pathfinder 0.6.9-Alpha](http://vsplugins.sitecore.net/Pathfinder/Sitecore.Pathfinder.zip)
1. Unzip the sitecore.tools directory in the zip file into an empty directory, e.g. c:\Program Files (x86)\Sitecore\Pathfinder 
(the path to scc.exe should now be c:\Program Files (x86)\Sitecore\Pathfinder\scc.exe)
1. Optional: Add the directory to your Path environment variable
1. Recommended: Some tasks require read/access to your tool directory and project directory, so make sure appropriate secutity settings are applied.
1. Done

### Npm
Sitecore Pathfincer is also available as a Npm package. Make sure that NodeJS and Npm is properly installed.

1. Install a Sitecore website (e.g. using [SIM (Sitecore Instance Manager)](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/modules/sitecore_instance_manager.aspx)
2. Create an empty directory (seperate from the Sitecore website directory)
2. Create a Npm package file (package.json) by running `npm init`
3. Run `npm install sitecore-pathfinder --save-dev`
4. In the package.json, add a command to the script section like this: 
```js
"scripts": {
    "scc": "run-scc"
}
```
5. Create a scc.cmd like this:
```cmd
@npm run scc %*
```

6. Done

To build the project, run either `scc.cmd` or `npm run scc`. 

### NuGet in Visual Studio
1. Install a Sitecore website (e.g. using [SIM (Sitecore Instance Manager)](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/modules/sitecore_instance_manager.aspx)
2. Create new project in Visual Studio (seperate from the Sitecore website directory)
3. Add the Sitecore.Pathfinder NuGet package to the package
4. Done

## Creating a new project
1. Install a Sitecore website (e.g. using [SIM (Sitecore Instance Manager)](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/modules/sitecore_instance_manager.aspx)
2. Create an empty directory (seperate from the Sitecore website directory)
3. Run `scc new-project` in the directory
4. Enter Project Unique ID, website directory, Data Folder directory and a hostname
5. Recommended: Some tasks require read/access to your tool directory and project directory, so make sure appropriate secutity settings are applied.
6. Done

## Creating a Pathfinder project in an existing directory
1. In the existing directory, run the `scc add-project` command. This will copy the required Pathfinder files to the directory
2. Done

## Importing an existing project
Importing a project copies items and files from an existing website to a Pathfinder project. You usually only do this once at the beginning of
a project. You need to configure which, how and where the website items and files are copied to the project.

1. Create a new (blank) project (see above)
2. Configure the `import-website` task in the scconfig.json file
3. Run `scc import-website` in the directory
4. Done

## The smoothest setup
* Add the Pathfinder binaries to your environment path, so it can be executed from anywhere.
* Use a project folder structure like this - it is compatible with ASP.NET 5, NodeJS and Sitecore serialization.
```
<project name>\
    bin\                 # ASP.NET binaries
    items\               # Sitecore items
        core\            # Sitecore core database items
        master\          # Sitecore master database items
    sitecore.project\    # Sitecore Pathfinder project files
    views\               # Razor views
    wwwroot\             # Files that are copied to the website
```

* Use the default website structure.
```
<website name>\          
    Data\                # Sitecore data folder
    Databases\           # Sitecore databases
    Website\             # Sitecore website
```

* Keep your project and website separate - this makes it easier to see what is in your project, and you can upgrade your website to another versionb easily.
* Setup website to projects mappings. This allows you to use the the `reset-website` task.
* Do not disable any checkers - the checkers are there for a good reason, and you should strive for no warnings or errors.
* Set the project-role to enable additional checkers, conventions and functionality.
* If you are using Visual Studio, consider adding scc.cmd as either a Post-Build step in Build Events or as an MSBuild AfterBuild task in the .csproj file.
* Use the `generate-code` task to automate trivial coding tasks.
* Use source control.

### Performance tips
* Don't use serialization items (*.item) - they are slow to deserialize.
* Consider using the `install-project` task instead of the creating and deploying a package. It speeds up the build process a lot.
* Consider using the `watch-project` task. Any change you make will be automatically deployed.
* Review and enable the zzz.Sitecore.Pathfinder.DevConfig.config in the /App_Config/include/Sitecore.Pathfinder directory.
* Review and enable the zzz.Sitecore.Pathfinder.LiveMode.config in the /App_Config/include/Sitecore.Pathfinder directory. After enabling, remove the `publish-database` tasks from from the `build-project:tasks` setting in scconfig.json.

## Command line help
To get help, you can execute the Help task by entering `scc help`.

To get help about a specific task, execute the Help task with the name of the task as a parameter: `scc help [task name]`
