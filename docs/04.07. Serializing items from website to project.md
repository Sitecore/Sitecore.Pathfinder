# Serializing items from website to project
Normally items flow from the project to the website, meaning that you create items as files in the project and when the project is
built and deployed the items are installed in the website.

However, if you want to use the web client, Sitecore Rocks, DB Browser or another tools to edit items, you can use TDS or Unicorn
to serialize items back to your project. You can also use Serialize Items in the web client Content Editor or the serialization
features in Sitecore Rocks.

Alternatively you can use the `import-website` task. You need to configure what, how and where items gets serialized.

For the CleanBlog startkit, the section looks like this:

```js
"project-website-mappings": {
    "project-to-website": {
    },

    "website-to-project": {
        "clean-blog-content": {
            "item-path-to-project-directory": "/sitecore/content/Home/CleanBlog => /items/master/sitecore/content/Home/CleanBlog",
            "format": "item.xml"
        },
        "clean-blog-media": {
            "item-path-to-project-directory": "/sitecore/media library/CleanBlog => /wwwroot/img",
            "format": "item.xml" 
        },
        "clean-blog-templates": {
            "item-path-to-project-directory": "/sitecore/templates/CleanBlog => /items/master/sitecore/templates/CleanBlog",
            "format": "item.xml" 
        },
        "clean-blog-css": {
            "website-directory-to-project-directory": "/css => /wwwroot/css" 
        },
        "clean-blog-js": {
            "website-directory-to-project-directory": "/js => /wwwroot/js" 
        },
        "clean-blog-renderings-files": {
            "website-directory-to-project-directory": "/CleanBlog/layout/renderings => /wwwroot" 
        }
    }
}
```
