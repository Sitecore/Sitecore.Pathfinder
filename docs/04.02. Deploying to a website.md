# Deploying to a website
Pathfinder installs a project by making a request to the installer on the website, passing
the ID of the package to install and a list of feeds. The feeds are directories where the installer searches
for packages to install. By default these are [Project]/sitecore.project for the output packages and
[Project]/packages for dependencies.

As such, Pathfinder does not copy the .nupkg files to website - the NuGet installer does that for Pathfinder.
Packages are unpacked in the website in the [Data]/pathfinder/packages directory.

This process requries the website to have read access to the project directory.
