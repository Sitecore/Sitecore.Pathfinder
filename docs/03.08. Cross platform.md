# Cross platform
Pathfinder is envisioned to become fully cross platform at some point. Currently Pathfinder is implemented in C# which binds it to the 
Windows platform. 

Pathfinder may take advantage of the upcoming .NET Core framework to support other platform or it may be rewritten in TypeScript
and run using NodeJS.
