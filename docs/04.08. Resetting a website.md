# Resetting a website
Sometimes it is nice to revert back to a known state on the website or simply clean up. The `scc reset-website` can delete items
and files on a website based on the project/website settings. Any items or files that are mapped back to the project in the
'project-website-mappings' settings will be deleted.

If you have additional items to be deleted using reset-website, you can configure them in the 'reset-website' settings.

```js
   "reset-website": {
        "clean-blog-renderings": {
            "delete-item-path": "/sitecore/layout/Renderings/CleanBlog" 
        }
    }
}
```

This will delete the /sitecore/layout/Renderings/CleanBlog item.
