# Layouts and renderings
Layout and rendering files (.aspx, .ascx, .cshtml, .html) are copied to the website directory and the Sitecore items are automatically created.
You no longer have to explicitly create and configure a Sitecore Rendering or Layout item. The relevate fields (including the Path field) are
populated automatically.
