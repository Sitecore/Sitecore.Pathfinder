# Layout engines

## Sitecore rendering engine
Pathfinder supports the Sitecore Rendering Engine by supporting a special format for the __Rendering field. 
The format is similar to Html and Xaml, and is parsed when the package is installed into Xml format, that 
Sitecore expects. 

Here is an example of the format in Json.
```js
{
    "Layout": {
        "Devices": [
            {
                "Name": "Default",
                "Layout": "/sitecore/layout/layouts/MvcLayout",
                "Renderings": [
                    {
                      "HelloWorld": {
                      } 
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```


## Html Templates
[Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aTGhW6ErYM)

Pathfinder also supports Html Templating which is simpler way of working with layouts. It resembles working with Mustache
Html Templates in JavaScript. However the Html Templates are resolved on the server and adapted to the Sitecore 
rendering engine.

When using Html Template, you do not have to specify a layout definition or use MVC views. Html Templates are not as 
powerful as the full Sitecore Rendering Engine, placeholders or using MVC views.

On an item, you specify the file name of the Html Template, you want to use, in the "Layout.HtmlFile" property (please notice 
that this property has been renamed from the video where it was called "HtmlTemplate").
```js
{
  "Item": {
    "Layout.HtmlFile": "/layout/renderings/HtmlTemplate.html",
  }
}
```

The Html Template is a Html file that also supports Mustache like tags.

```html
<h1>Fields</h1>
<p>
    {{Title}}
</p>
<p>
    {{Text}}
</p>
{{> Footer.html}}
```

The `{{Title}}` tags will be replace with the Title field in the current context item.

Please notice that Mustache lists and partials are supported (see the Footer tag in the last line). Pathfinder extends the 
Mustache syntax to support Sitecore placeholders - the tag `{{% placeholder-name}}` will be rendered as a Sitecore
placeholder.

Pathfinder creates .html as View renderings and these renderings can used as any other Sitecore rendering.
