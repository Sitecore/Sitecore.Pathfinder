# Directives 
Item files (Json, Xml and Yaml) may contain directives that affect the way the file is parsed. 

Supported directives:

Directive        | Description
-----------------|-------------
File.Include     | Includes another file (specified by the Key attribute)
File.Placeholder | In an included file, specifies location where the inner content of the File.Include directive is injected.


## File.Include
Item files can include other files. This allows parts of items files to be shared among multiple items. 

Below is how to include other files in an item file.

Json:
```js
{
    "Item": {
        "Template": "/sitecore/templates/Sample/JsonItem",
        "Fields": {
            "File.Include": [
                {
                    "File": "~/includes/Field.include.item.json" 
                },
                {
                    "File": "~/includes/ParameterizedField.include.item.json",
                    "Name": "ParameterizedField",
                    "Value": "Parameterized Value"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Yaml:
```yaml
Item :
    - Fields :
        - File.Include : ~/includes/Field.include.item.yaml
        
        - File.Include : ~/includes/ParameterizedField.include.item.yaml
          Name  : ParameterizedField
          Value : Parameterized Value

```

Xml:
```xml
<Item xmlns="http://www.sitecore.net/pathfinder/item">
    <Fields>
        <File.Include File="~/includes/Field.include.item.xml" />
        <File.Include File="~/includes/ParameterizedField.include.item.xml" Name="ParameterizedField" Value="Parameterized Value"/>
    </Fields>
</Item>
```

The first included file looks like this:

```js
{
    "IncludeField": {
        "Value": "Included field."
    }
}
```

Include files are not simple text subsitutions, but are resolved at the lexing level of the compiler (before parsing). The File.Include directive 
is also part of the item schemas, which means that include files cannot be included at arbitrary positions. This is to ensure 
Syntax Highlighting, Validation and IntelliSense still work.

Include files can be parameterized as can be seen in the second include file above. Parameters are simple text substitions. Parameter 
tokens are prefxied with '$' in the include file. Below is the second include file from the example above.

```xml
<Field Name="$Name" Field.ShortHelp="Include field." Field.LongHelp="Include field.">$Value</Field>
```

### Predefined parameters.

Parameter Name             | Description 
-------------------------- | ------------
$ItemPath                  | The path of the item
$FilePathWithoutExtensions | The file path without extensions
$FilePath                  | The file path including extensions
$Database                  | Database name
$FileNameWithoutExtensions | The file name without extensions
$FileName                  | The file name including extensions
$DirectoryName             | The current directory name

Please notice: Include files do not work everywhere yet.

## File.Placeholder
A File.Include directive may contain additional content to be injected into the included file (if you are a Sitecore veteran, think Xml Controls and Xaml#).
The injected content is placed inside a Placeholder element. An include file can specify multiple placeholders - each identified by a key. The default key
is empty (or blank).

Below is an example of an include directive with inner content. The content is specified under the Placeholders element and the "" specifies the empty key.
In the example the content is a field named "PlaceholderText" with the value "Placeholder text.".

```js
"File.Include": {
    "File": "~/includes/PlaceholderItem.include.item.json",
    "ItemName": "PlaceholderItem",
    "Placeholders": {
        "": {
            "PlaceholderText": {
                "Value": "Placeholder text.",
                "Field.ShortHelp": "Placeholder Text.",
                "Field.LongHelp": "Placeholder Text."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The include file looks like this:
```js
{
    "$schema": "../../../../sitecore.pathfinder.console/files/project/sitecore.project/schemas/item.schema.json#",
    "Item": {
        "Name": "$ItemName",
        "Template": "/sitecore/templates/Sample/JsonPlaceholderItem",
        "Template.CreateFromFields": true,
        "Template.ShortHelp": "Short help.",
        "Template.LongHelp": "Long help.",
        "Template.Icon": "Application/16x16/About.png",

        "Fields": {
            "File.Placeholder": { }
        }
    }
}
```

The element "File.Placeholder" specifies that the Placeholder with the empty key should be inserted here.
