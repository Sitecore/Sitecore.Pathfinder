# Introduction
Pathfinder is an experimental toolchain for Sitecore, that allows developers to use their favorite tools 
in a familiar fashion to develop Sitecore websites.

The toolchain creates a deliverable package from the source files in a project directory and deploys 
the package to a website where an installer installs the new files and Sitecore items.

The developer process is familiar; edit source files, build and install the package, run tests or review the changes on website, repeat.
