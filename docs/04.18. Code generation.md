# Code Generation
Pathfinder can generate code based on your project. The most obvious thing is to generate a C# class for each template in
the project.

To generate code, execute the task `generate-code`. This wil iterate through the elements in the project and check if
a code generator is available for that item. If so, the code generator is executed.

Code generators are simply extensions that are located in the [Tools]/extensions/codegen directory.

Normally you want to run the `generate-code` task before building an assembly, so the C# source files are up-to-date.
