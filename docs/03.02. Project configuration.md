# Configuration
Pathfinder is configured using a global configuration file, a project configuration file, and optionally a machine/project configuration file 
and a user configuration file. The user, machine/project and project configuration files can overwrite any settings in the 
global configuration file.

The global configuration is located in the [Tools] directory. You should never change this file. Instead overwrite settings in 
the project or user configuration files.

[Global configuration: /sitecore.tools/scconfig.json](https://github.com/JakobChristensen/Sitecore.Pathfinder/blob/master/src/Sitecore.Pathfinder.Console/scconfig.json)

The project configuration file is located in the root of the project: [Project]/scconfig.json.

[Project configuration: /scconfig.json](https://github.com/JakobChristensen/Sitecore.Pathfinder/blob/master/src/Sitecore.Pathfinder.Console/files/project/scconfig.json)

The user configuration file is optional and is located next to the project configuration file. It has the extension .user.

1. [Tools]/scconfig.json (global configuration)
1. [Project]/scconfig.json (project configuration)
1. [Tools]/files/project.roles/scconfig.role.[Project role].json (project role configuration)
1. [Project]/scconfig.*.json (module configuration)
1. [Project]/scconfig.[MachineName].json (machine/project configuration)
1. [Project]/scconfig.json.user (user configuration)

Any configuration file specified on the command line.

## Project/website item and file mappings
The filesystem structure of the project does not necessary corresponds to the desired structure on the website.

In the [Project]/scconfig.json file, you can map files and items to different locations on the website.

```js
// mapping between project files and website files and items
"project-website-mappings": {
    "project-to-website": {
        "master": {
            "project-directory-to-item-path": "/items/master/sitecore => /sitecore",
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/items/master/sitecore => /"
        },

        "core": {
            "project-directory-to-item-path": "/items/core/sitecore => /sitecore",
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/items/core/sitecore => /",
            "database": "core"
        },

        "bin": {
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/bin => /bin",
            "file-name-include": "*.dll"
        },

        "wwwroot": {
            "project-directory-to-item-path": "/wwwroot => /",
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/wwwroot => /",
            "upload-media": false
        },

        "views": {
            "project-directory-to-item-path": "/views => /sitecore/layout/renderings",
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/views => /views"
        }
    },

    "website-to-project": {
    }
}
```
