# Configuration
Pathfinder is configured using a global configuration file, a project configuration file, and optionally a machine/project configuration file 
and a user configuration file. The user, machine/project and project configuration files can overwrite any settings in the 
global configuration file.

The global configuration is located in the [Tools] directory. You should never change this file. Instead overwrite settings in 
the project or user configuration files.

[Global configuration: /sitecore.tools/scconfig.json](https://github.com/JakobChristensen/Sitecore.Pathfinder/blob/master/src/Sitecore.Pathfinder.Console/scconfig.json)

The project configuration file is located in the root of the project: [Project]/scconfig.json.

[Project configuration: /scconfig.json](https://github.com/JakobChristensen/Sitecore.Pathfinder/blob/master/src/Sitecore.Pathfinder.Console/files/project/scconfig.json)

The user configuration file is optional and is located next to the project configuration file. It has the extension .user.

1. [Tools]/scconfig.json (global configuration)
1. [Tools]/scconfig.json.user (global user configuration)
1. Any environment variables
1. [Project]/scconfig.json (project configuration)
1. Any project role configuration files
1. [Project]/scconfig.*.json (module configuration)
1. [Project]/scconfig.[MachineName].json (machine/project configuration)
1. [Project]/scconfig.json.user (user configuration)
1. Any configuration file specified on the command line using the `--config` switch
1. Any command line switches

If there is no scconfig.json file in the current directory and the directory contains files or directories, Pathfinder loads the
[Tools]/files/project.noconfig/scconfig.json file.

## Project/website item and file mappings
The filesystem structure of the project does not necessary corresponds to the desired structure on the website.

In the [Project]/scconfig.json file, you can map files and items to different locations on the website.

```js
{
    // every project must have a unique id, since the project-unique-id is used to calculate item ids
    "project-unique-id": "{project-unique-id}",

    // website directories and host name
    "website-directory": "c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Sitecore.Default\\Website",
    "data-folder-directory": "c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Sitecore.Default\\Data",
    "host-name": "http://sitecore.default",

    // user name and password
    "user-name": "sitecore\\admin",
    "password": "b",

    // default Sitecore database name (master, core, or web)
    "database": "master",

    // the project roles enables/disables checkers and conventions - comma seperated list of roles
    "project-role": "default",

    // mapping between project files and website files and items
    "project-website-mappings": {

        // mapping items and files to website when building a project
        "project-to-website": {
            "master": {
                "project-directory-to-item-path": "/items/master/sitecore => /sitecore",
                "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/items/master/sitecore => /"
            },

            "core": {
                "project-directory-to-item-path": "/items/core/sitecore => /sitecore",
                "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/items/core/sitecore => /",
                "database": "core"
            },

            "bin": {
                "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/bin => /bin",
                "file-name-include": "*.dll"
            },

            "wwwroot": {
                "project-directory-to-item-path": "/wwwroot => /",
                "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/wwwroot => /",
                "upload-media": false
            },

            "views": {
                "project-directory-to-item-path": "/views => /sitecore/layout/renderings",
                "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/views => /views"
            }
        },

        // mapping items and files to project when importing a website
        "website-to-project": {
        }
    },

    // tasks to execute when building
    "build-project": {
        "tasks": "restore-packages check-project write-exports pack-nuget copy-dependencies copy-package install-package publish-database show-website show-metrics"
    },

    // package dependencies
    "dependencies": {
        "Sitecore.Master" : "1.0.0" 
    } 
}
```
