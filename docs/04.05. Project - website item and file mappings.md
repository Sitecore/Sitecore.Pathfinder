# Project/website item and file mappings
The filesystem structure of the project does not necessary corresponds to the desired structure on the website.

In the [Project]/scconfig.json file, you can map files and items to different locations on the website.

```js
// mapping between project files and website files and items
"project-website-mappings": {
    "project-to-website": {
        "master": {
            "project-directory-to-item-path": "/content/master/sitecore => /sitecore",
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/content/master/sitecore => /"
        },

        "core": {
            "project-directory-to-item-path": "/content/core/sitecore => /sitecore",
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/content/master/sitecore => /",
            "database": "core"
        },

        "bin": {
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/bin => /bin",
            "file-name-include": "*.dll"
        },

        "wwwroot": {
            "project-directory-to-item-path": "/wwwroot => /",
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/wwwroot => /",
            "upload-media": false
        },

        "views": {
            "project-directory-to-item-path": "/views => /sitecore/layout/renderings",
            "project-directory-to-website-directory": "/views => /views"
        }
    },

    "website-to-project": {
    }
