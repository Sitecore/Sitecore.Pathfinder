Sitecore.Pathfinder.Core
============================

This is the core API of Pathfinder. The Core is used by both the Sitecore.Pathfinder.Console and
Sitecore.Pathfinder.Server, meaning that it run both client side and server side.

It is important that the Core has no dependencies on Sitecore, since it can run client side.
