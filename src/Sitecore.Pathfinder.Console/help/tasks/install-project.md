install-project
===============
Installs the project directly from the project directory.

Remarks
-------
The `install-project` installs the project directly from the project directory. This skips the package creation and package copying (both
project packages and dependency packages). This saves a bit of time, if you are in a hurry.

Settings
--------
None.

Example
-------
```cmd
> scc install-project
```
