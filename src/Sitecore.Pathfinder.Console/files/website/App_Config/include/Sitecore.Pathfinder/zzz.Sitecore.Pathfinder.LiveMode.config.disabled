<!--
    Purpose: This include file enables live mode, so that data is read directly 
    from the master database, thereby bypassing the need to publish.

    To enable this, rename this file so that it has a ".config" extension.
    Once enable, you can remove the 'publish-database' tasks in the 
    'build-project:tasks' setting in the scconfig.json.

    Notice how "patch:attribute" is used to change the value of attributes that 
    are specified for an existing element in the web.config file.
